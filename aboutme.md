title: About me
---


I'm currently an ML scientist at [anthem.ai](https:/anthem.ai), working on applied clinical research problems using EHR's. 

In the past, I was a data scientist at [Beyond Limits](https:/beyond.ai), and did research internships at [toSense](https://www.tosense.com/) and [Maxim Integrated](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en.html). 

I also did some fun medical imaging AI work with [Dr. Baowei Fei](https://be.utdallas.edu/people/faculty/baowei-fei/) and neurostimulation work with [Dr. Michael Kilgard](https://bbs.utdallas.edu/faculty/detail.php5?i=311) during my undergrad, which was in Cognitive Science from UT-Dallas. 

I also draw whenever I have the motivation, primarily with either pen or digital. 

My research can be found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fSyeqzAAAAAJ&hl=en).
